# SudarshanKriya

This app is intended as a supplement for the popular Sudarshan Kriya Meditation routine. It was born through the frustration of having to count breathes and seconds to properly do the routine while also supposedly letting go and thinking of nothing. 

This app was successful when released on the app store, garnering close to 600 downloads with zero promotional advertising.

It guided users through a series of timed bells to let them know when to breathe in and out, as well as an animated figure to guide the hand movements.

This was my first foray into Spritekit and game animations on IOS.
